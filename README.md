## Description
```md
The task for this assignment was to build an API for a social network web application using MongoDB, express.js and the Mongoose ODM.  
The application was tested using Insomnia. I also used date-fns to format dates.
```

**User Story**

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

**Acceptance Criteria**

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

Create thought for user brandon.
![example image 3 delete thoughts when user deleted](./assets/ch18-screen3-show-delete-user-thoughts.png)

View all thoughts to confirm the new thought has been created for Brandon.
